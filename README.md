## Reflection on Project Management Tools

Using GitHubâ€™s project management features like milestones, issues, and project boards can significantly improve collaboration and project organization. **Milestones** provide a clear vision of project goals and deadlines, keeping the team aligned and focused. **Issues** serve as a centralized way to document and prioritize tasks, making it easier to track bugs, feature requests, and ongoing work. Assigning issues to team members creates accountability and clarifies responsibilities. **Project boards** offer a visual way to see task progress, helping everyone understand what is being worked on, what is pending, and what is completed.

One challenge we might face is keeping the board and issues updated regularly, as the pace of work can vary. It may also be difficult to estimate task durations accurately, leading to potential delays. However, with regular check-ins and clear communication, these tools can help mitigate confusion and make the project more efficient overall.
